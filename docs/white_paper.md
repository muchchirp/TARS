# TARS: Transparent Auditable Resilience System for WireGuard Deployment

---

## Abstract

We propose TARS, a system for secure and verifiable deployment of WireGuard VPN servers. TARS introduces cryptographic birth certificates and proof-of-life mechanisms to ensure server integrity and provenance. By treating servers as disposable appliances that can be dynamically added or removed, TARS addresses the challenges of scalable VPN deployments while preserving user privacy and anonymity. The system leverages open-source software and cryptographic techniques to provide a low-cost, transparent, and auditable solution.

## 1. Introduction

Dynamic deployment of VPN servers presents challenges in maintaining security, integrity, and user privacy. Traditional methods lack mechanisms for real-time verification of server states, especially in environments where servers are frequently added or removed to meet demand. We introduce TARS (Transparent Auditable Resilience System), a protocol that ensures servers remain in a trusted state throughout their lifecycle using cryptographic proofs.

## 2. High-Level Overview for Non-Technical Readers

Imagine a secure vault that holds sensitive information. When the vault is first built, it receives a unique, tamper-proof seal—a **birth certificate**—that records every aspect of its construction. This seal ensures that the vault was built correctly and securely from the very beginning.

Once the vault is in use, we want to make sure that no one has tampered with it. To do this, the vault regularly checks every single component—every lock, hinge, and panel—to confirm that nothing has changed since it was built. It then sends out a **proof certificate** to a public bulletin board, confirming that it remains secure and untouched. This happens at precise intervals, so if the proof doesn't appear on time, or if it shows unexpected changes, we immediately know something is wrong.

However, we understand that certain parts of the vault need to change over time—like the combination to the lock or authorized user lists. These changes are expected and safe. The birth certificate lists these changeable parts, so when we check the vault's integrity, we know to exclude them. This way, we focus only on unauthorized changes that could compromise security.

In the context of **TARS and WireGuard VPN servers**:

- Each server receives a **cryptographic birth certificate** upon creation, recording its exact initial state.
- The server monitors **every single bit** of its system, excluding specific dynamic parts like configuration files for public keys and IP addresses, as well as system-level files that naturally change.
- These excluded bits are documented in the birth certificate, proving they don't affect user privacy.
- At regular, precise intervals, the server publishes a **proof certificate** to a public blockchain, confirming that its critical components remain unchanged and uncompromised.
- If the proof certificate doesn't appear on time or shows unauthorized changes, alarms are triggered, indicating potential compromises and risks to privacy.

For **VPN users**, this means:

- **Your privacy is safeguarded** because any tampering with the server is quickly detected.
- **No logs or personal data** are stored on the server that could jeopardize your anonymity.

## 3. System Overview

TARS operates on two foundational components:

### 3.1 Cryptographic Birth Certificates

Upon deployment, each server generates a birth certificate comprising:

- Initial cryptographic keys
- Configuration files (e.g., `wg0.conf`)
- Software versions (e.g., Linux kernel, WireGuard version)
- List of dynamic files excluded from integrity checks

This information is hashed using a cryptographic hash function \( H \) and signed with the server's private key \( k_{\text{priv}} \):

\[
B = \text{Sign}_{k_{\text{priv}}}(H(m))
\]

where \( m \) represents the concatenation of the server's initial state, including the list of excluded files. The birth certificate \( B \) is then published to a public, immutable log (e.g., a blockchain), allowing verification by any party using the corresponding public key \( k_{\text{pub}} \):

\[
\text{Verify}_{k_{\text{pub}}}(H(m), B) = \text{True}
\]

### 3.2 Proof-of-Life Signals

At regular intervals \( t \), the server generates a proof-of-life hash of its current state, monitoring every bit except for the excluded dynamic files:

\[
S_t = \bigcup_{f \in F_{\text{core}}} \text{Content}(f)
\]

\[
P_t = \text{Sign}_{k_{\text{priv}}}(H(S_t))
\]

where \( F_{\text{core}} \) is the set of core files that should not change, and \( \text{Content}(f) \) is the content of file \( f \). These proofs are published to the public blockchain, enabling real-time verification:

\[
\text{Verify}_{k_{\text{pub}}}(H(S_t), P_t) = \text{True}
\]

Any alteration in the server's core files results in a hash mismatch, indicating potential tampering.

---

## 4. Dynamic WireGuard Configuration Handling

WireGuard servers often require dynamic updates to handle fluctuating user demand. TARS accommodates this through two approaches:

### 4.1 Server-Sent Events (SSE) Approach

In environments utilizing SSE for automatic updates to `wg0.conf`, frequent legitimate changes occur. TARS addresses this by:

- **Excluding variable configuration files** (e.g., `wg0.conf`) from the integrity hash, as listed in the birth certificate.
- **Documenting these exclusions** in the birth certificate to prove they do not impact user privacy.

The server state for proof-of-life excludes these dynamic files:

\[
S_t = \bigcup_{f \in F_{\text{core}}} \text{Content}(f)
\]

### 4.2 Database-Driven Approach

For deployments using databases to manage configurations, TARS includes the database schema but excludes dynamic data in the hash computation:

\[
S_t = H\left( \text{Schema}(D_t) \cup \bigcup_{f \in F_{\text{core}}} \text{Content}(f) \right)
\]

where \( D_t \) is the database at time \( t \), and only its schema is included to detect unauthorized structural changes.

## 5. Security Analysis

### 5.1 Integrity and Tamper Detection

The security of TARS relies on the properties of cryptographic hash functions and digital signatures:

- **Pre-image Resistance**: Prevents attackers from forging a server state that produces a known hash.
- **Collision Resistance**: Ensures that two different states cannot produce the same hash.

Any unauthorized change in \( S_t \) will yield a different \( H(S_t) \), causing verification to fail and triggering alarms.

### 5.2 User Privacy and Anonymity

TARS ensures:

- **No Traffic Logging**: Open-source code and verifiable server states prevent hidden logging mechanisms.
- **Anonymity**: Without access to private keys or logs (which are absent), linking user identities to server traffic is infeasible.

### 5.3 Closed-Box Operation

Servers operate without external management interfaces post-deployment. Their sole external communication is the publication of proof-of-life hashes, minimizing attack vectors.

---

## 6. Implementation Details

### 6.1 Cryptographic Primitives

- **Hash Function \( H \)**: SHA-256 is used for hashing server states.
- **Digital Signature Algorithm**: Ed25519 is employed for its balance of security and performance.

### 6.2 Public Blockchain Mechanism

An append-only, immutable ledger (e.g., a blockchain) is used to store birth certificates and proof-of-life hashes. This ensures transparency and prevents retroactive alterations. The regular intervals at which proofs are published allow for timely detection of anomalies.

---

## 7. Scalability and Performance

The computational overhead of hashing and signing is minimal:

- **Hashing Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the size of \( S_t \).
- **Signing Complexity**: Constant time operations due to efficient algorithms like Ed25519.

This efficiency allows TARS to scale to large numbers of servers without significant performance degradation.

---

## 8. Advantages of TARS

- **Real-Time Tampering Detection**: Immediate identification of unauthorized changes enhances security response.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Built entirely on open-source tools, reducing deployment costs.
- **Transparency and Trust**: Publicly verifiable proofs foster trust among users and stakeholders.
- **Adaptability**: Supports various deployment architectures, including SSE and database-driven models.
- **User Privacy Assurance**: By excluding dynamic configurations from integrity checks and documenting them in the birth certificate, TARS proves that these changes do not compromise user privacy.

---

## 9. Future Work

Future enhancements may include:

- **Automated Revocation**: Integrating mechanisms to automatically decommission compromised servers.
- **Extended Proofs**: Incorporating additional system metrics into proof-of-life hashes.
- **User Verification Tools**: Developing client-side applications for users to verify server integrity independently.

---

## 10. Conclusion

TARS provides a robust framework for secure and verifiable deployment of WireGuard VPN servers. By leveraging cryptographic techniques, it ensures server integrity, enhances user privacy, and adapts to dynamic scaling requirements. The system's regular proof-of-life publications to a public blockchain enable timely detection of compromises, safeguarding user data and trust. TARS stands as a potential industry standard for transparent and auditable VPN deployments.
